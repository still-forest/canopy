/**
 * Responsive utility functions for handling Tailwind CSS breakpoint-based values
 *
 * Note: This file previously contained getResponsiveClasses, getResponsiveConditionalClasses,
 * and isResponsiveValue utilities. These have been removed as the library now uses explicit
 * class maps to ensure all CSS classes are visible to the Tailwind compiler at build time.
